Hello! Not a fitness coach, just a moron online, but here's a pretty decent workout program for you as a beginner. I recommend you take at least 48 hours of rest between each session, 3-4 days after finishing Day 3, since you are a beginner, you will need to feel it off and see how your body responds. Typically, I say you don't train again until you have been free of soreness for 48 hours, as you are then 100% sure your muscles, tendons and ligaments are 100% recovered :)
The program:

Day 1: Upper Body & Core

Push-Ups: 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions

Dips (using parallel bars at the playground or chairs at home): 3 sets of 8-12 reps

Inverted Rows (using a bar at the playground): 3 sets of 8-12 reps

Leg/knee raises: As many as possible x 1 set (you can start with leg raises, then do knee raises when you start hitting failure)

Day 2: Lower Body & Core

Squats: 3 sets of 12-15 reps

Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg

Bulgarian Split Squats (using a bench or chair): 3 sets of 8-10 reps per leg

Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 12-15 reps

Leg/knee raises: As many as possible x 1 set

Day 3: Full Body

Pull-Ups (use a pull-up bar at the playground, assisted if necessary): 3 sets of 5-8 reps

Push-Ups: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

Bodyweight Rows (use rings or TRX if available): 3 sets of 8-12 reps

Squats: 3 sets of 12-15 reps

Leg/knee raises: As many as possible x 1 set

Take a solid minute between each set! And try to make sure you're hitting failure at the last set. When I say failure I mean; you should not be able to do another positive rep (eg the "push up" portion of the push-up) at all when you are done. If you have any questions, hit me up, I am always ready to help! Enjoy!

For someone weighing 155 lbs and is 6'2" as you stated, here's a simple yet effective routine to consider.

First, focus on compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Begin with three sets of squats, aiming for 8-12 reps per set to build lower body strength. Follow this with three sets of bench presses or push-ups to work the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Incorporate bent-over rows or pull-ups for back strength, aiming for the same 8-12 rep range.

Additionally, include overhead presses or shoulder presses to target the deltoids. Finally, finish with core exercises like planks or Russian twists to strengthen the abdominal muscles. Aim to do this routine three times a week, allowing at least one day of rest between sessions to facilitate muscle recovery and growth.

In addition to strength training, incorporate cardiovascular exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, or cycling for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week to improve heart health and burn calories. Remember to stay hydrated, maintain proper form during exercises, and gradually increase the intensity or resistance as your strength improves. Consistency and proper nutrition are key for achieving and maintaining overall fitness goals. Hope this is helpful to you.

A good 6-day workout routine for the gym should be balanced, challenging, and adaptable to different fitness levels.

Modifications and Adaptations

This sample 6-day workout routine can be modified and adapted to meet individual needs and goals. For example, the number of sets and reps can be adjusted based on fitness level and desired intensity. Additionally, exercises can be substituted or added to target specific muscle groups or address individual needs. For example, if someone wants to focus on building their glutes, they can add in exercises like hip thrusts or glute bridges on lower body strength training days.

It is also important to include rest days in any workout routine to allow the body time to recover and prevent overtraining. Rest days can be scheduled in between workout days, or incorporated into the workout routine as active recovery days, where lighter activities such as yoga or walking are performed.

Conclusion

A 6-day workout routine for the gym should be balanced, challenging, and adaptable to individual needs and goals. Incorporating a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups and including both strength training and cardiovascular exercise can help improve overall fitness and health. Modifying and adapting the workout routine as needed can help individuals stay motivated and achieve their desired results. As with any new exercise routine, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting.
